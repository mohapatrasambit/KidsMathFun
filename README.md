# KidsMathFun
Simple fun with math for little kids.

My kids in elementary school, come and often ask me to write down some simple addition, subtraction, etc questions which they love to solve. Just to make it easier on me, wrote this simple program, to generate random equations with random numbers. This doesn't guarantee to be bug free. 

I have used C# almost all my life so far, thought of trying out Java with this simple program to find the differences.

## Build
```mvn clean package```
